# DoveLink - Frontend

The frontend is built with `vite„ÄÅReact`.

## Frontend Development

First of all, change directory by using the command:

```
cd frontend
```

Within the `frontend` directory, install the necessary NPM packages:

```
npm install
```

And start the live server by running:

```
npm run start
```

Then open your browser at http://localhost:5173/.

When the backend is started, go to http://localhost:5173/login, where you can choose `Register` button to register as a `student`, and choose `Login` button to login.

## Code Structure

The frontend code is structured as follows:

- `frontend/src` - The main frontend code.
- `frontend/src/components` - The different components of the frontend.
- `frontend/src/hooks` - Custom hooks.
- `frontend/src/pages` - Pages of the website.
- `frontend/src/services` - API of the elements.
- `frontend/src/styles` - CSS files.
